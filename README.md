The sample raw LST data and the code of the SARIMA model to fill in the missing LST information can be downloaded here.
## SARIMA model
The Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) model, which is one of the ARIMA models, is an effective way to perform time series forecasting of LST data. The LST was obtained from Landsat 8 OLI (30 metres), here integrated into research units.
